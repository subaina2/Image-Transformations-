# Image Transformations and File Handling
This is a mini-project of my Programming Fundamentals Course that focuses on developing a menu-driven program for digital image processing using ASCII PGM files. The program offers file handling functionalities like opening and saving files. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of tools inspired by commonly used image processing Irfan-view software.
It has 20 functions to transform any pgm file like rotating , fliping and applying filters.
